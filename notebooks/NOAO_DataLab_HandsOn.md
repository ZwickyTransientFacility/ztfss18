# NOAO Data Lab Hands-on (Friday afternoon)

Anytime before the hands-on session, please get your free account at
Data Lab:

https://datalab.noao.edu/help/register.php?qa=register

We only ask for your name, affiliation, and email address.

The account comes with 1 TB / 250 GB of storage on VOSpace / MyDB, and
gives you persistent notebooks, sessions, etc.

During the hands-on (Fri 3:30 to ~4:30pm) we will be working together
through several notebooks (Data Lab basics, and specific science
cases). You don't have to install anything, we'll do everything in the
Data Lab Jupyter environment in the browser. Just have your laptop and
Data Lab account ready.
